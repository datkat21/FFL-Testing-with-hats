# FFL-Testing Fork with Hats

I'm not very good at C++ so I had a lot of help from arian :)
This is also a very WIP version, because of no hat texture and it's using the body shader because of reused code..
and the RootTask.cpp got formatted..

### Sample images

<img src="./doc/jasmine_hat_test_switch.png" width=240>
<img src="./doc/jasmine_hat_test_studio.png" width=240>
</div>

### Usage & info

The query parameters to use hats are named after my mii creator app, and the hats follow the same IDs. I do not plan to have UGC hats at this point in time.
Original `.glb` files are in the `fs/content/models` folder alongside the rio models, because those converted models don't have material info so it's good to have source models.

Example query parameters: `&hatType=2&hatColor=1` gives you the red beanie.

### Goals

- [x] Display hat models
- [x] Color hat models
- [ ] Proper hat materials and textures
- [ ] Hats in glTF export

There's also a lot of unused files in here that I just left over since this is the FFL-Testing fork i had locally and was messing around with for a long while..

# Running the renderer server

Why is this in the FFL-Testing repo under another branch? This server is built off of the FFL-Testing sample by Abood (or in other words, hackily patched from it).

I keep telling myself that, after a rewrite, it can be moved into its own repo, so bare with me...

1. Follow the instructions included below, which are also in master.
   - I don't think the server portion will work on a Wii U due to use of hardcoded OpenGL calls here, so don't try.
   - Get to the point where it shows you spinny Mii heads.
   - ... But if you are running on a VPS/headless system, see step 4.
2. The service requires two parts: the renderer, which is in ffl_testing_2_debug64, and the web server. You'll need to run either the Python or the Go web server.
   - Python
     - Needs Flask, also note that it's more limited in features and performance
     - Run `server-impl/ffl-testing-web-server-old.py`
   - Go
     - Inside `server-impl` just `go run .` or run the Go file
3. Make sure FFL-Testing is running and listening, and try a request like this to the server: http://localhost:5000/miis/image.png?data=005057676b565c6278819697bbc3cecad3e6edf301080a122e303a381c235f4a52595c4e51494f585c5f667d848b96&width=512
4. If that works, great! Keep these in mind:
   - If you are hosting this, **always use the SERVER_ONLY=1 environment variable when running.**
     - Hides the window, doesn't swap buffers, and pauses when idle.
   - If you are running this on a VPS, build with **OSMesa support** so that you don't have to run an X11 server.
     - Build and also apply optimizations: `CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" DEFS="-DRIO_USE_OSMESA" make`
     - Note that OSMesa does **NOT support hardware rendering**, and should only be used if you don't have a GPU! If you do, you'll need to constantly run Xvfb or something.

5. Advanced: If you want to "scale" this... (longer, so read more)
</summary>

- .. My only solution is to run multiple processes right now.
  - This actually needs my nwf-mii-cemu-toy, ffl-renderer-proto-integrate branch.
  - Clone it like so: `git clone -b ffl-renderer-proto-integrate https://github.com/ariankordi/nwf-mii-cemu-toy`, build and run.
- I recommend setting this up as a systemd _socket activated, instanced service._ - This means you can run it like so: `systemctl start ffl-testing@31100` - where 31100 is the port number, which you can change, and also enable the service to start it at boot. - **You will need to rebuild, once again**, with `USE_SYSTEMD_SOCKET` as a def. \* If you're following along on your VPS, it's this: `CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" DEFS="-DRIO_USE_OSMESA -DUSE_SYSTEMD_SOCKET" make` - Edit `ffl-testing@.service`. Adjust the `WorkingDirectory`, `ExecStart` (program path), and potentially user. - Copy the systemd units in this repo: `sudo cp ffl-testing@.service ffl-testing@.socket /etc/systemd/system/`
</details>

_Please be aware of the limitations to this in production - probably won't scale well._ \* TBD: Improved accuracy (accurate per-bone body scaling), server rewrite, multi-threading, all-in-one renderer and HTTP server in the same binary.

**Note:** For the frontend on mii-unsecure.ariankordi.net, I am using [nwf-mii-cemu-toy, ffl-renderer-proto-integrate branch](https://github.com/ariankordi/nwf-mii-cemu-toy/tree/ffl-renderer-proto-integrate) as the HTTP server for now, where I've more or less copied the Go server. It supports load balancing to multiple instances of this server.
**That is where my client-side HTML, JS, and \***NNID fetch API**\* and more are hosted, so if you want to rehost any of that, PLEASE see that repo's readme!**

# FFL-Testing

Sample using [the FFL decomp](https://github.com/aboood40091/ffl) and [RIO framework](https://github.com/aboood40091/rio), all originally written by [AboodXD](https://github.com/aboood40091), to render Miis on PC and Wii U via WUT.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdc358e4-0b1f-4b93-b7fd-f61fa4d215e1

## Running

1. Clone the repo, _recursively_.
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/ariankordi/FFL-Testing
   ```
2. Install requirements.

   This project needs GLFW3, zlib, and OpenGL dev libraries. The commands below will install them.

   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libglfw3-dev zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`
   - Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install glfw-devel zlib-devel mesa-libGL-devel`
   - Arch/Manjaro: `sudo pacman -S glew glfw zlib` (⚠️ UNTESTED)
   - MSYS2 MINGW64 (Windows): `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib`
     - Make sure to also install the basics: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config`
     - **Use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`**
     - As of 2024-06-02, this doesn't copy DLLs from MinGW64's environment to yours so you can launch the program in the command line, you can't click on the exe to run it.
     - _Also note that it should build with MSVC, but I don't have a cxxproj for you to use / this should be ported to CMake at some point..._

   If you are building with WUT, you need to install `ppc-zlib`.

3. Build using the makefile.

   If you don't already have them, you will also need: git, g++, make, pkg-config.

   ```
   make -j4
   ```

   - To build with WUT, use: `make wut -j4`.

   - This also supports OpenGL ES 3.0, for mobile devices or using ANGLE. To build targeting that, define this as an environment variable: `DEFS="-DRIO_GLES"`
   - To build for Emscripten, use `make -f Makefile.emscripten -j4`
     - Make sure FFLResHigh.dat is in the current working directory. After this builds, open the html file.

4. Obtain the resource file, FFLResHigh.dat.
   - This contains the meshes and textures needed to render Mii characters and is absolutely required to get anywhere with this.
   - You can get it from many sources:
     - It can be extracted from a Wii U using an FTP program:
       - `sys/title/0005001b/10056000/content/FFLResHigh.dat`
     - You can extract it from a Miitomo install (_it's not in the APK/IPA_):
       - In cache (`Library/Application Support/cache` on iOS), here: `res/asset/model/character/mii/AFLResHigh_2_3.dat`
     - It can also be downloaded from archive.org:
       - https://web.archive.org/web/20180502054513/http://download-cdn.miitomo.com/native/20180125111639/android/v2/asset_model_character_mii_AFLResHigh_2_3_dat.zip
       - Extract the above and rename `AFLResHigh_2_3.dat` to `FFLResHigh.dat`.
     - (As well as `AFLResHigh_2_3.dat`, `AFLResHigh.dat` will work too. All AFL resources have to be renamed to `FFLResHigh.dat`.)
     - In the Kadokawa breach, there is a Wii U tool called FFLUtility, located here: `dwango/projects/マルチデバイス/品証/WiiU/Tool/FFL/downloadimage/FFLUtilityJP_p01` - if you decrypt it with dev keys, then in `fs/content/nonproduct/miicapture/resource/`, you will find `FFLResPoster.dat`. This is a copy of FFLResHigh.dat with extremely high quality (512px) textures. If you successfully find this, share the love and enjoy.
   - Place that file in the root of this repo.
     - This file contains models and textures needed to render Miis and this program will not work without it.
5. Run `ffl_testing_2_debug64`, and pray that it works.
   - If it crashes with a segfault or shows you a blank screen, make sure you have `FFLResHigh.dat` and it can open it.

### Showing your own Miis

As of 2024-06-14, I added a change that would let you change which Miis this program renders, by reading files in the `place_ffsd_files_here` folder.

As the name implies, you should be able to take any Mii in a 96 byte FFSD/FFLStoreData file, and place it in that folder.

- Only the length of the file is checked, not the extension or name. It needs to be 96 bytes.

- Then, it will just read each file sequentially, looping through all of them.
- You can also just put one file there and that one Mii will spin continuously.

#### If you don't have any FFSD files...

- You can search for any _.ffsd or _.cfsd (CFLStoreData = FFLStoreData) file in this repo:

  - https://github.com/HEYimHeroic/MiiDataFiles

- Grab the Mii from your Nintendo Network ID using the mii-unsecure.ariankordi.net API, if it is still up by the time you are reading this.
  - `curl --verbose --header "Accept: application/octet-stream" https://mii-unsecure.ariankordi.net/mii_data/JasmineChlora --output JasmineChlora.ffsd`
    - Replace `JasmineChlora` with your own NNID, of course.
- I believe this script decrypts Mii QR Code data directly to FFSD/CFSD format: https://gist.github.com/jaames/96ce8daa11b61b758b6b0227b55f9f78
  - I use it with ZBar like so: `zbarimg --quiet --raw --oneshot -Sbinary image.jpg | python3 mii-qr.py /dev/stdin ./mii.ffsd`
    - Replace: `image.jpg`, `mii.ffsd`
  - I also made a scanner in JS, though it gives you Base64 that you have to decode: https://jsfiddle.net/arian_/h31tdg7r/1/

### Compiling GLFW3

<details>
<summary>
GLFW3 is needed to run any RIO application on PC, which this is.

If you can't install it (not on Linux or MSYS2), or need the latest version, let's build it.

**(You probably don't need to follow these)**

</summary>

### GLFW3:

- `git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw && cd glfw`
- `cmake -S . -B build`
  - If you are cross compiling, append: `-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=CMake/x86_64-w64-mingw32.cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/x86_64-w64-mingw32/`
- `cmake --build build -j8`
- (sudo) `cmake --install build`

### Now it should be available to pkg-config

Try: `pkg-config --libs zlib glfw3`

(Unless it complains about needing `glu`)

#### If you are still reading

NOTE from 2024-06-02: To cross compile this from Linux to Windows, I used the following command:
`TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32- make LDFLAGS="-L/dev/shm/glfw/build/src/ -lz -L/dev/shm/glew/lib/ -lglew32 -lglfw3 -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lws2_32`

Where I have glew and glfw built at /dev/shm.

While pkg-config worked, letting me need only the TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX set, for whatever reason it wasn't building and threw lots of linking errors saying it couldn't link tons of symbols from glew32 even though it literally finds it and opens the library, so... IDK.
